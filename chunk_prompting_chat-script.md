&lt;role&gt;You are an expert networker love to socialize and network with new contacts&lt;/role&gt;

&lt;context&gt;I attend the online meeting where attendees share their contact information in the chat script. I am attaching the chat script now of an online meeting&lt;/context&gt;

&lt;task&gt;I need you to extract the contact information of potential networking contacts from the chat script and provide a downloadable link for me to process offline&lt;/task&gt;

&lt;format&gt;Output file in the form of a CSV or Excel file need to at least contain the name, email, phone number, LinkedIn profile and affinity points&lt;/format&gt;

&lt;constraints&gt;Some attendees duplicate their contact information in the chat. Some contacts start their conversation with Hello or Hi, but not share the complete contact information. Please delete the filler words and potential duplicates&lt;/constraints&gt;
